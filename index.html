  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> July 3, 2025</p>

  <p>
    Thank you for choosing to be part of the Think First community (“Think First,” “we,” “us,” or “our”).
    We are committed to protecting your privacy and empowering users to take control of their interactions
    with AI tools. If you have any questions or concerns about our policy or our practices,
    please contact us at <a href="mailto:thinkfirstai@gmail.com">thinkfirstai@gmail.com</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you use our Chrome extension, you trust us with your data. That’s why we built Think First to work
    <strong>entirely offline</strong>, without collecting any personal information. This privacy policy explains how
    we handle your data (or more accurately—how we avoid it), and outlines your rights and choices.
  </p>

  <p>
    This privacy policy applies only to the Think First Chrome extension and any related services or content
    we provide through the extension (the “Services”).
  </p>

  <h2>1. What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
  <p><strong>None.</strong> Think First does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.</p>
  <p>We do not collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your name, email, or contact details</li>
    <li>Your IP address or location</li>
    <li>Your browsing history or website content</li>
    <li>Your interactions with ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, or Gemini</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The extension uses only local browser storage to remember your settings
    (e.g., whether it’s enabled or disabled, your chosen GIF style). This data never leaves your device.
  </p>

  <h2>2. How Do We Use Your Information?</h2>
  <p>
    We don’t. Since we don’t collect any personal data, there’s nothing to use. The extension runs
    locally on your device and reacts to on-screen events (e.g., detecting when an AI response is streaming).
  </p>

  <h2>3. Will Your Information Be Shared with Anyone?</h2>
  <p>No. We don’t collect or transmit any data, so we have nothing to share or sell.</p>

  <h2>4. Do We Use Cookies or Trackers?</h2>
  <p>No. Think First does not use cookies, fingerprinting, or third-party analytics tools of any kind.</p>

  <h2>5. How Do We Handle Your Privacy Settings?</h2>
  <p>
    All user settings (e.g., enabling/disabling the extension, GIF preferences) are stored locally using
    Chrome’s <code>storage</code> API. You may reset or remove them by uninstalling the extension.
  </p>

  <h2>6. What Are Your Privacy Rights?</h2>
  <p>Since we don’t collect or store personal data, there is no data to review, update, or delete. You are in full control.</p>

  <h2>7. How Do We Keep Your Data Safe?</h2>
  <p>By not collecting it in the first place. Think First operates entirely offline and does not send or receive information from external servers.</p>

  <h2>8. Updates to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this privacy policy to reflect improvements or changes to the extension. If we make significant changes,
    we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this page periodically.
  </p>

  <h2>9. How to Contact Us</h2>
