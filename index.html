  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 3, 2025</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Think First is a Chrome extension designed to encourage mindful interaction with AI tools by displaying humorous or calming GIFs during AI-generated responses on platforms like ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, and Claude.
    Your privacy is extremely important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights as a user.
  </p>

  <h2>What Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    Think First does <strong>not collect</strong> or transmit any personal data, identifiable information, or browsing activity.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>❌ No names, emails, or contact details</li>
    <li>❌ No IP addresses or location data</li>
    <li>❌ No AI prompt contents or website content</li>
    <li>❌ No cookies, trackers, or analytics</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Local Storage</h2>
  <p>
    Think First uses <strong>Chrome’s local storage API</strong> to save your preferences, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Whether the extension is enabled or disabled</li>
    <li>Which GIFs are selected for display</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This data is stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong>. It is never uploaded, shared, or accessible by the developers.
  </p>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    Think First requests minimal permissions necessary to function:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> To remember your extension settings locally.</li>
    <li><strong>Host permissions:</strong> To detect when supported AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, Claude) begin streaming a response so the extension can display the appropriate GIF. No content on these pages is read, stored, or accessed beyond what's needed to trigger the animation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing & Selling</h2>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not share, sell, or transmit</strong> any data to third parties. Think First is a privacy-first tool that operates entirely on-device.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Think First does not knowingly collect or process data from children under the age of 13. Because no personal data is collected, there is no risk of accidental disclosure.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    Since Think First does not collect or transmit data, your information is inherently secure. We follow best practices for extension development and do not use remote code or third-party libraries that compromise user safety.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Control</h2>
  <p>
    At any time, you may uninstall the Think First extension and all local preferences will be removed from your browser automatically. You can also disable the extension temporarily via the toggle in the popup.
  </p>
